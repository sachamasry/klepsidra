        COMMENT 'Whether author info has been verified',
    
    CONSTRAINT birth_before_death
        CHECK (birth_date < death_date)
);
```

#### Collections System

```sql
-- Main collections table for organizing quotes
CREATE TABLE collections (
    collection_id UUID
        PRIMARY KEY
        COMMENT 'Unique identifier for the collection',
    
    user_id UUID
        REFERENCES users(user_id)

        NOT NULL
        COMMENT 'Collection name',
    
    description TEXT
        COMMENT 'Collection description',
    
    is_public BOOLEAN
        DEFAULT false
        COMMENT 'Visibility setting',
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
        DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
        DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    CONSTRAINT unique_user_collection_name
        UNIQUE (user_id, name)
);

-- Junction table for quotes in collections
CREATE TABLE collection_quotes (
    collection_id UUID
        REFERENCES collections(collection_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
    quote_id UUID
        REFERENCES quotes(quote_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
    added_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
        DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        COMMENT 'When the quote was added to collection',
    
    PRIMARY KEY (collection_id, quote_id)
);
```

#### Common Query Patterns

#### 1. Fetching a Quote with Related Data

```sql
SELECT 
    q.quote_id,
    q.text,
    a.name AS author_name,
    s.title AS source_title,
    array_agg(DISTINCT c.name) AS categories,
    array_agg(DISTINCT t.name) AS tags
FROM quotes q
LEFT JOIN authors a ON q.author_id = a.author_id
LEFT JOIN sources s ON q.source_id = s.source_id
LEFT JOIN quote_categories qc ON q.quote_id = qc.quote_id
LEFT JOIN categories c ON qc.category_id = c.category_id
LEFT JOIN quote_tags qt ON q.quote_id = qt.quote_id
LEFT JOIN tags t ON qt.tag_id = t.tag_id
WHERE q.quote_id = [quote_id]
GROUP BY q.quote_id, a.name, s.title;
```

#### 2. User's Favorite Quotes

```sql
SELECT 
    q.text,
    a.name AS author_name,
    uf.favorited_at
FROM user_favorites uf
JOIN quotes q ON uf.quote_id = q.quote_id
JOIN authors a ON q.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE uf.user_id = [user_id]
ORDER BY uf.favorited_at DESC;
```

#### 3. Finding Similar Quotes

```sql
SELECT 
    q2.quote_id,
    q2.text,
    similarity(q1.text, q2.text) AS similarity_score
FROM quotes q1
JOIN quotes q2 ON q1.quote_id != q2.quote_id
WHERE q1.quote_id = [quote_id]
AND similarity(q1.text, q2.text) > 0.3
ORDER BY similarity_score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Data Integrity Rules

1. **Cascading Deletes**:

   * Collection quotes are deleted when collection is deleted
   * Tags are preserved when quotes are deleted
   * Annotations are preserved when quotes are deleted

2. **Constraints**:

   * Authors must have name
   * Quotes must have text and author
   * Collections must have owner and name
   * Birth date must be before death date

3. **Soft Deletes**:

   * User accounts are deactivated, not deleted
   * Quotes are marked private, not deleted
   * Maintains data integrity and history

### Complete Database Relationships Analysis

#### Direct Relationships

##### User-Related Relationships

1. **Users → Roles** (Many-to-Many)

   * Through `user_roles` junction table
   * Enables flexible permission management
   * `users.user_id → user_roles.user_id`
   * `roles.role_id → user_roles.role_id`

##### Category-Related Relationships

1. **Categories → Categories** (Self-Referential)
   * Enables hierarchical category structure
   * `categories.parent_category_id → categories.category_id`
   * Optional relationship (NULL for root categories)

#### Indexing Strategy

##### 1. Primary Key Indexes

* Automatically created for all PRIMARY KEY constraints
* Uses B-tree data structure
* Example tables: users, quotes, authors, collections

```sql
-- Already created by PRIMARY KEY constraints
CREATE INDEX pk_users ON users(user_id);
CREATE INDEX pk_quotes ON quotes(quote_id);
CREATE INDEX pk_authors ON authors(author_id);
```

##### 2. Foreign Key Indexes

```sql
-- Quote relationships
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_author ON quotes(author_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_source ON quotes(source_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_created_by ON quotes(created_by);

-- Collection relationships
CREATE INDEX idx_collections_user ON collections(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_collection_quotes_quote ON collection_quotes(quote_id);

-- Category relationships
CREATE INDEX idx_categories_parent ON categories(parent_category_id);

-- User interaction indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_user_favorites_user ON user_favorites(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_annotations_user ON user_annotations(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_annotations_quote ON user_annotations(quote_id);
```

##### 3. Full-Text Search Indexes

```sql
-- Quote text search
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_text_search ON quotes 
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', text));

-- Author name search
CREATE INDEX idx_authors_name_search ON authors 
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', name));

-- Source title search
CREATE INDEX idx_sources_title_search ON sources 
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', title));
```

##### 4. Composite Indexes for Common Queries

```sql
-- User collections by name
CREATE INDEX idx_collections_user_name ON collections(user_id, name);

-- Quotes by language and verification status
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_lang_status ON quotes(language_code, verification_status);

-- Quote categories with timestamp
CREATE INDEX idx_quote_categories_timestamp ON quote_categories(quote_id, category_id, created_at);
```

##### 5. Performance Optimization Indexes

```sql
-- Timestamp-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_created_at ON quotes(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_updated_at ON quotes(updated_at);

-- Verification status queries
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_verification ON quotes(verification_status);

-- Public/private content queries
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_public ON quotes(is_public);
CREATE INDEX idx_collections_public ON collections(is_public);
```

##### 6. Specialized Indexes

```sql
-- B-tree index for range queries on dates
CREATE INDEX idx_authors_dates ON authors(birth_date, death_date);

-- Hash index for exact matches
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_name_hash ON tags USING HASH (name);

-- GiST index for similarity searches
CREATE INDEX idx_quotes_similarity ON quotes 
USING gist (text gist_trgm_ops);
```

##### Index Maintenance Considerations

1. **Automated Maintenance**

   ```sql
   -- Regular index statistics update
   ALTER TABLE quotes SET (autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.1);
   ALTER TABLE quotes SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.2);
   ```

2. **Index Usage Monitoring**

   ```sql
   -- Query to monitor index usage
   SELECT 
    schemaname || '.' || tablename as table_name,
    indexname,
    idx_scan as number_of_scans,
    idx_tup_read as tuples_read,
    idx_tup_fetch as tuples_fetched
   FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
   WHERE idx_scan = 0
   AND schemaname NOT LIKE 'pg_%'
   ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;
   ```

3. **Performance Impact Considerations**

* Indexes improve query performance but impact write operations
* Regular monitoring of index usage
* Removal of unused indexes
* Periodic reindexing of fragmented indexes

## Trip tracker

### Key Features

1. User Onboarding and Profiles: Collect basic user details, such as nationality, home country, and countries they frequently visit or plan to visit. This will help determine relevant visa requirements and legal limits.

2. Trip Tracking (Entries & Exits):

* Entry/Exit Logging: Users should be able to log their entry and exit dates for each country.
* Automatic Date Calculation: Calculate the total number of days spent in each country based on entry/exit dates.
* Remaining Days Alert: Notify users of remaining days in the country before reaching legal limits.

1. Legal Limit Information:

* Visa and Residency Rules Database: Track different types of visas and residency rules (e.g., Schengen 90/180-day rule, tourist visas, digital nomad visas, etc.).
* Country-Specific Limits: Keep a database of countries’ unique requirements, such as day limits, renewal options, and penalties for overstaying.

1. Notifications and Alerts:

* Threshold Alerts: Notify users when they are nearing their legal stay limit in a particular country.
* Visa Expiry Reminders: Alert users when they need to renew or apply for a new visa.

1. Dashboard and Reports:

   * Overview of Time Spent: Show a summary of days spent across all visited countries within a certain period.
   * Historical Log: Provide a log of past visits for each country.
   * Compliance Status: Indicate compliance or risk level for each country based on historical stays and upcoming plans.

2. Analytics:

   * Day-by-Day Calculator: Calculate remaining days under specific visa requirements, e.g., 90 days in a 180-day rolling period for the Schengen Area.
   * Forecasting: Estimate how long a user can legally stay in a country in the future if they re-enter on a particular date.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Implementation Steps

1. Database Design:
   * User Table: Stores user info (e.g., name, nationality, home country).
   * Country Rules Table: Includes visa requirements, day limits, and other legal limits for each country.
   * Visit Logs Table: Tracks entry and exit dates per user per country.
   * Notification Table: Logs alerts sent to users, such as nearing legal limit notifications.
2. Backend Logic:

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Several regions and economic blocks have collective visa or entry policies that apply to the entire block rather than individual countries. Here’s an overview of some key visa blocks and regional entry agreements that function similarly to the Schengen Area:

1. Schengen Area (Europe)

* Countries: 27 European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and others.
* Entry Policy: Travelers can move freely between member states with a single Schengen visa. Stays are typically limited to 90 days within a 180-day period for non-residents.
* Note: Some countries, like Switzerland and Norway, are in the Schengen Area but not in the EU, which means the Schengen visa policy applies without EU residency rights.

1. CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME)

* Countries: Caribbean nations like Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and others within the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).
* Entry Policy: Nationals of CARICOM countries are often allowed to travel visa-free between member states for extended stays, especially if they are engaging in work or business.
* Note: For non-CARICOM nationals, visa policies may differ by country within CARICOM, but agreements for the free movement of people are expanding.

1. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)

* Countries: Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman.
* Entry Policy: GCC nationals can travel freely between member states without a visa. However, for tourists and foreign workers, a visa policy may vary slightly between countries.
* Visa Options for Visitors: Some member states issue a GCC Resident Visa, which can allow residents of one GCC country to visit others for short stays without needing a separate visa.

1. Central America-4 (CA-4) Border Control Agreement

* Countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
* Entry Policy: Under the CA-4 agreement, visitors can travel freely between these countries for up to 90 days total within the region (not per country). Extensions may be available but apply to the region as a whole, not individual countries.
* Note: This is similar to the Schengen model but with fewer countries involved and more limited mutual agreements.

1. East African Tourist Visa

* Countries: Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.
* Entry Policy: A single East Africa Tourist Visa allows entry to all three countries for 90 days. Travelers can move freely between these countries within this period.
* Note: This visa is available for tourism only. Other travel purposes, like work or study, require individual visas.

1. Pacific Alliance

* Countries: Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.
* Entry Policy: While there is no unified tourist visa yet, the Pacific Alliance aims to facilitate free movement. Citizens of these countries can often travel visa-free within the alliance for short stays, and member states are working on mutual visa waiver agreements for broader mobility.
* Note: For tourists from outside the alliance, visa policies may vary by country, but the alliance has plans to harmonize entry requirements in the future.

1. Mercosur (Southern Common Market)

* Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and associate members like Chile, Bolivia, and Peru.
* Entry Policy: Nationals of Mercosur countries can travel freely for work, residence, and tourism within the bloc. Tourists from non-Mercosur countries must comply with individual visa policies per country.
* Note: Member countries offer temporary residence visas to other Mercosur nationals, which allows longer stays and simplified work authorization.

1. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)

* Countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam.
* Entry Policy: ASEAN nationals can travel visa-free within the bloc for tourism for varying durations depending on the countries involved. Efforts are underway to create an ASEAN common visa for non-ASEAN tourists, though it’s still in development.
* Note: For now, the ASEAN common visa remains a goal, and each country maintains its own visa policy for non-ASEAN nationals.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Table: `visa_types`

This table will serve as a lookup for all possible visa types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE visa_types (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,            -- Unique identifier for each visa type
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- E.g., "Tourist Visa," "Business Visa," "Work Permit"
    description TEXT,               -- Optional: description of what the visa type entails
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Table: `visas`

Defines different visa types, their durations, and any other requirements for each country.

| Column        | Type      | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id            | UUID      | Primary key, unique identifier for each visa type.           |
| country_id    | UUID      | Foreign key referencing countries(id).                       |
| visa_block_id | UUID      | Foreign key referencing the block to which the visa applies. |
| visa_type     | VARCHAR   | Name/type of the visa (e.g., tourist, business, nomad).      |
| duration_days | INT       | Maximum duration allowed under this visa.                    |
| renewable     | BOOLEAN   | Indicates if the visa is renewable.                          |
| requirements  | TEXT      | Specific requirements for obtaining the visa.                |
| updated_at    | TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp for the visa data.                     |

```sql
CREATE TABLE visas (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    country_id UUID REFERENCES countries(id),       -- Country the visa applies to
    visa_block_id UUID REFERENCES visa_blocks(id), -- Optional: Block the visa applies to (e.g., Schengen)
    visa_type_id UUID REFERENCES visa_types(id),   -- Normalized visa type
    visa_rules_summary TEXT,                       -- Description of visa requirements/rules
    max_stay_limit INT,                            -- Maximum days allowed to stay
    in_force_from DATE NOT NULL,                   -- Date the visa rules came into force
    in_force_until DATE,                           -- Optional: End date if the rule is no longer valid
    succeeded_by UUID REFERENCES visas(id),        -- Links to the next version of the visa rules
    preceeded_by UUID REFERENCES visas(id),        -- Links to the previous version of the visa rules
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Handling Superseded Visa Rules

The addition of `in_force_from`, `in_force_until`, and `succeeded_by` allows for clear versioning:

```
•   `in_force_from` and `in_force_until`: Define the time range during which the visa rules are valid.
•   `succeeded_by` and `preceeded_by`: Form a chain of rule changes, allowing the application to trace historical changes.
```

This structure ensures that users see the most recent, in-force rules but can query historical data if needed.

##### Benefits of Normalizing visa_type:

1. Data Integrity: Ensures consistent naming and eliminates the risk of typos or slight variations (e.g., “Tourist Visa” vs. “tourist visa”).
2. Query Efficiency: Queries filtering by visa type can be performed on indexed IDs, which are faster to search than strings.
3. Reduced Redundancy: Instead of storing the same string repeatedly in multiple rows, only the foreign key (UUID) is stored.
4. Flexibility: Additional metadata about each visa type (e.g., descriptions, eligibility) can be added to the visa_types table without altering the visas schema.

#### Example Data

`visa_types` Table

```sql
INSERT INTO visa_types (id, name, description) VALUES
('1', 'Tourist Visa', 'Allows entry for leisure travel'),
('2', 'Business Visa', 'Allows entry for business-related activities'),
('3', 'Work Permit', 'Grants permission to work in the destination country'),
('4', 'Student Visa', 'Allows enrollment in educational institutions');
```

`visas` Table

```sql
INSERT INTO visas (id, country_id, visa_block_id, visa_type_id, visa_rules_summary, max_stay_limit, in_force_from)
VALUES
('v1', 'france-id', 'schengen-id', '1', '90 days in Schengen area', 90, '2022-01-01'),
('v2', 'japan-id', NULL, '1', '90 days visa-free travel for selected countries', 90, '2022-01-01'),
('v3', 'usa-id', NULL, '2', 'Business visits up to 180 days', 180, '2021-06-01');
```

#### Query Examples

Filter by Visa Type:

To retrieve all visas for “Tourist Visa”:

```sql
SELECT v.*
FROM visas v
JOIN visa_types vt ON v.visa_type_id = vt.id
WHERE vt.name = 'Tourist Visa';
```

Group by Visa Type:

To count visas by type:

```sql
SELECT vt.name, COUNT(v.id) AS visa_count
FROM visas v
JOIN visa_types vt ON v.visa_type_id = vt.id
GROUP BY vt.name;
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Table: `visa_blocks`

To handle visa blocks in the database schema, you can add a visa_block entity to capture these shared policies:

```sql
CREATE TABLE visa_blocks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    max_stay INT,                     -- Maximum stay in days, e.g., 90
    stay_period INT,                   -- Period within which max_stay applies, e.g., 180 for "90 days within 180 days"
    shared_visa_policy BOOLEAN,        -- Indicates if a single visa applies to the whole block
    description TEXT                   -- Description of any special rules or policies
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE country_visa_blocks (
    country_id UUID REFERENCES countries(id),
    visa_block_id UUID REFERENCES visa_blocks(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (country_id, visa_block_id)
);
```

With this setup:

* Each visa block (e.g., “Schengen Area,” “CA-4”) has rules applied to all associated countries.
* The country_visa_blocks table allows linking countries to visa blocks, so when a user enters a country in a block, the app can check block-level rules.

This approach makes it easy to track which countries participate in each block and enforce block-wide limits on stays and visas.

#### Versioned Country and Visa Blocks Integration

To integrate countries and visa blocks, the schema can rely on the `country_visa_blocks` table while keeping a historical record of changes to block membership:

```sql
CREATE TABLE country_visa_blocks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    country_id UUID REFERENCES countries(id),
    visa_block_id UUID REFERENCES visa_blocks(id),
    membership_in_force_from DATE NOT NULL,        -- When the country joined the block
    membership_in_force_until DATE,               -- When the country left the block (if applicable)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

This setup ensures you can:

1. Track when a country joined or left a visa block.
2. Handle scenarios where countries temporarily suspend participation (e.g., Brexit-like scenarios).
3. Keep historical records for reports and audits.

#### Example Data Scenarios

1. Schengen Area Example

A visa_block entry for Schengen might look like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO visa_blocks (id, name, max_stay, stay_period, shared_visa_policy, description) 
VALUES ('1', 'Schengen Area', 90, 180, TRUE, 'Single visa for travel within the Schengen Zone');
```

1. Visa Rules for Schengen

Visa rules for Schengen could evolve like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO visas (id, country_id, visa_block_id, visa_type, visa_rules_summary, max_stay_limit, in_force_from, succeeded_by) 
VALUES 
('v1', NULL, '1', 'Tourist Visa', 'Allows 90 days of travel within 180-day period', 90, '2022-01-01', NULL),
('v2', NULL, '1', 'Tourist Visa', 'Updated rules for 90 days travel within 180-day period (COVID-19 exceptions)', 90, '2023-01-01', 'v3');

UPDATE visas SET succeeded_by = 'v2' WHERE id = 'v1';
```

1. Country Membership in Schengen

```sql
INSERT INTO country_visa_blocks (id, country_id, visa_block_id, membership_in_force_from) 
VALUES ('c1', 'france-id', '1', '1995-03-26');
```
