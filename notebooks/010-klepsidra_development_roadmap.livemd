# Development Roadmap

## Outline

1. [Release 0.1.3](#release-013) <== Current
2. [Release 0.1.4](#release-014) <== In development
3. [Release 0.1.5](#release-015)
4. [Release 0.1.6](#release-016)
5. [Release 0.2](#release-02)
6. [Release 0.3](#release-03)
7. [Someday/maybe](#somedaymaybe)

## Release 0.1.3

Ensure all code works, that any obvious bugs have been quashed.

* [X] Tagging projects
* [X] Tagging journal entries
* [X] Make it possible to drill into the tag from the live component
* [X] Provide ability to set new tag colour when creating freeform tag in live component
* [X] Improve search functionality to perform fuzzy query directly in the database
* [X] Develop ability to cope with temporary data structures, before an entity has been created
* [X] Reformat timer listing display to a more useful format, relegating full description field to a popup box or tooltip, showing only a truncated version spanning at most two lines
* [X] Change date display to more informative format
* [X] Allow stopping a timer from timer 'show' view
* [X] Changing the tag selection in any way on a modal screen should send back a message only if it's inside a _show_ view which also has a tag selector in it

## Release 0.1.4

Implement basic _trip tracker_ functionality, recording how many days have been spent in each country or block, with particular regard to visa regulation regimes.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Implement a _notes_ functionality, where users can record snippets of any thoughts, information needed for later, inspirations, and any other information deemed useful for the future.

The inspiration for this feature, most directly, is [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

> TiddlyWiki, a unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information

What is incredibly useful about this software is that these snippets can be opened alone, together with other _tiddleres_, which can be expanded or collapsed, or closed entirely at any time.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* [X] Creation of quotes and citations of wisdom entity
* [X] Meaningful display of quotes in a prominent place
* [X] Develop a more generic patch of `phoenix_live_head`, and push as a PR, for the library to be extended upstream.
* [X] Create new feature, recording time spent in economic territories/countries, for nomads, showing how close to limit they are, according to the prevailing legislation
  * [X] Create `users` entity
  * [X] Create `document_types` entity
  * [X] Create `document_issuers` entity
  * [X] Create `documents` entity
  * [X] Create `trips` entity
  * [X] Add country entry and exit points in `trips`
* [X] Create _notes_ functionality
  * [X] Implement note tagging
  * [X] Develop full-text search on new and general _notes_ entity
    * [X] Develop FTS virtual table and all necessary triggers keeping it up to date
    * [X] Develop the context necessary to be able to query the FTS virtual table
    * [X] Develop the Live Component enabling the search
  * [X] Develop FTS search inside `live_select` component, merely as a rich way of finding records to select in forms
  * [X] Implement note interlinking
    * [X] Create `knowledge_management_relationship_types` entity
    * [X] Create `knowledge_management_links`entity
    * [X] Develop infinite note interlinking, with relationship types
    * [X] Convert note relationships into stream assigns
    * [X] On creation of new relation, add to stream
    * [X] Permit deletion, and removal from stream
  * [X] Develop a FTS search feature, opening a page listing all matching results
    * [X] Develop unified entity view
    * [X] Create FTS table
    * [X] Create query for completely rebuilding the FTS table from the view
    * [X] Create mix task for easy rebuilding of FTS table
    * [X] Implement global search view
    * [X] Implement global search view, displaying all results directly in the view, not a modal
* [X] UI and UX improvements
  * [X] Start implementing new colour scheme based around Peach Fuzz, Pantone 13-1023
* [ ] Refactoring
  * [ ] Clean up all timer queries: there is much duplication among timer queries, with complex code and doubled-up business logic. Reduce the quantity of code, duplication, and logic
* [ ] Debugging
  * [X] Tagging notes that haven't yet been saved doesn't work
  * [X] Updating notes fails with the following error message:
  * [X] Journal entries cannot be viewed as the show view breaks
  * [ ] There seems to be an issue when the last tag has been removed from an edit view, and a new one is manually added in the show view, where suddenly both are attached to the entity, only temporarily, on the `show` view (still recorded somewhere in component)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Debugging

* [ ] A new bug is present in production, in timer `form_component` views, related to the tag `live_select` component:

## Release 0.1.5

Audit all existing code for documentation quality, documenting missing functionality; ensure _all_ functionality has type specifications; ensure _all_ backend functionality has at least basic unit tests defined; add property tests where relevant.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* [ ] Consider splitting trip recording into single border crossings, instead of entry/exit pairs
* [ ] Create simple tasks/to-do feature, taking fields and functionality from `act` software

  * [ ] Create `country_visa_blocks` entity
* [ ] Increase the power of knowledge base notes, through forced spaced repetition, automated by the system
* [ ] _Today_ view
  * [ ] Provide daily navigation facility: back and forward a day; jump to today
* [ ] Timer reporting and analysis
  * [ ] Develop tag-based filtering in the reporting view
  * [ ] Report on aggregate time spent, or timed, by tag, reporting on tag _show_ page
  * [ ] Report on aggregate time spent by activity type, reporting on activity_type _show_ page
* [ ] Develop soft-delete/undelete in database ([Automatic Undo/Redo Using SQLite](https://sqlite.org/undoredo.html))

* [ ] Search and FTS index improvements
  * [ ] Create protocol for rebuilding the FTS index, and its periodicity
    * [X] Established automatic, cron-like hourly rebuild protocol
    * [ ] Plan for more sophisticated rebuild trigger, one based aroung time delay and actual database change

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### UI/UX

* [ ] Rebuild CSS around new colour scheme and two new typefaces: Advocate (?) and selected Huerta Tipografica typeface, or Calluna & Calluna Sans
* [ ] Randomise colours for new tags
* [ ] Display tags for open and closed timers, on timer listings
* [ ] Restyle timer listings, giving more visual value to the time recorded, rather than the times the timer was started and stopped
* [ ] Clean up timer information presentation, particularly in the show view
* [ ] Convert all colour references to OKLCH
* [ ] Notes improvements
  * [ ] Improve UX through less intrusive, modal relationship creation
  * [ ] Improve note entry textarea field: make it possible to expand the textarea, without it shrinking back to default size with each input event
  * [ ] When creating a new note, on note save transport user directly to newly created note
  * [ ] Inside note show views, add '+ New note' button, making it easy to quickly create new notes while reading existing notes
  * [ ] On timer note timeline, next to the `created_on` date, display the `updated_on` date in a visually highlighted way, showing that a note was edited and when
  * [ ] Ensure a second warning message is displayed to the user, ensuring they truly understand the impact of deleting a timer with notes attached
  * [ ] Look for good UX examples, as this is likely to become a UX annoyance, more than a saviour of data loss
  * [ ] Develop a _card_ component
    * [ ] Wrap the _quote of the day_ component in a card, for a more visually delineated aesthetic
    * [ ] Apply the quote component on the _show_ view, cleaning up extraneous information
    * [ ] Apply the quote component on the _listing_ view, creating a new listing interface, moving away from a merely tabular presentation
  * [ ] Make notes accessible to uses outside the application, through a text editor, provided in Markdown and possibly plain text formats
  * [ ] Make note relationship linking possible from _within_ notes, in a LogSeq or other wiki-style manner, using double brackets `[[...]]` or braces `{{...}}`, and have the link automatically reified at save time

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Refactoring

* [ ] Refactor out conditional statements in `render` statements and page templates, leading to improved performance

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Miscellaneous

* [ ] Cross-platform development: port application to OpenBSD to test whether it works on that OS
  * [ ] Migrate entire development effort to OpenBSD as a primary developemnt host

## Release 0.1.6

* [X] Expand full text search to encompass all relevant tables and fields in application
  * [X] Enable SQLite notes fields full-text search (timers, business partners, projects)
  * [X] Enable SQLite description fields full-text search (tags, projects)
* [ ] Use SQLite built-in functionality to regularly create database backup

## Release 0.2

By this point, the application is not only fully self-hosted, but can also be used by a wider range of users—it is not yet widely usable, but is acceptable to power users and those willing to be active testers of the system.

During the lifetime of this release, adopt one consistent UI component system, converting the application to using it. Fully audit the entire user interface, unifying it in a new direction, ensuring the system is consistent and visually easy to use.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* [ ] Audit other timers for strengths and weaknesses
* [ ] Permit pausing and resuming timers; add forward-pointing field to next timer, like a linked list
* [ ] Extend tagging functionality
  * [ ] Provide way to _deactivate_ old tags
  * [ ] Make it possible to _merge_ tags which are similar, where having both starts causing complications
  * [ ] Develop way to create tag hierarchies
* [ ] UI/UX improvements
  * [ ] Select a UI component framework, to aid in the building of a modern web app
  * [ ] Resize datetime, duration and duration unit controls to more efficiently use space
  * [ ] Redevelop all series 0.1.x views, modularising displays into reusable components
  * [ ] Improve on cryptic or incomplete UI error messages
  * [ ] Calculate duration of open timers, client-side, updating continuously
  * [ ] Replace timer listing description pop-up (title attribute), with a proper HTML-formatted popover component

## Release 0.3

* [ ] UI/UX improvements
  * [ ] Incorporate Gov.uk Design System (https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) accessibility and user interface/experience decisions, starting from input controls
  * [ ] Start implementing colour palette
  * [ ] Improve presentation of currency fields; at present they use an input control of type 'number' which is unintuitive UX
* [ ] Look into default `timestamps()` fields; it appears that datetime stamps are in UTC, where local timezone may be preferable
  * [ ] This is most specifically important for timestamps recorded for notes and activities, where the times reported may be relied on by users

## Someday/maybe

### Multitasking

One major area at which web applications fall short is multitasking; in the desktop paradign, we have been trained to enjoy the ability to run multiple programs side by side, and to open windows next to each other for cross-reference. Web apps cannot do this, and usually—at best—only provide modal content as an attempt at a solution.

Logseq provides a real alternative to this problem, taking its cue from TiddlyWiki: it opens a permanent sidebar, which can be populated with any kind of content. This content can be stacked up endlessly, any or all items can be minimised to reduce clutter, and any and all can also be closed. The sidebar stays populated with the option of choice for the duration of the session.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* [ ] Multitasking
  * [ ] Provide a sidebar in which _any_ type of content, and any number of entitits can be openedo Once opened, this content lives in the sidebar for continues reference; any item can be minimised or closed (‘Logseq: A Privacy-First, Open-Source Knowledge Base’).
  * [ ] This sidebar is a permanent _companion_ to the app. Whichever area of the system people are in, the sidebar is present (though it can be hidden), with the information previously opened in it (‘Logseq: A Privacy-First, Open-Source Knowledge Base’.).

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

* Start creating an undo feature, reducing reliance on confirmation dialogs,
  particularly for deletions
  * Build an audit trail-like functionality, to be able to undo any deletion
    or modification, at any time, as well as to see a history of actions
    taken
* Document truncate and markdown_to_html functions
* Markdown and other markup languages
  * Provide ability to use other popular markup languages: Org-mode, TiddlyWiki, etc.
  * Refactor conversion of plain text to Markdown everywhere; should
    interpretation happen at table layout level, or earlier at query level?
  * Create a dedicated field to markdown text, and another for HTML, to improve
    performance, by not requiring just in time mardown interpretation
* Expand role of activity types beyond the hour rate, to act as a rigid
  categorisation for major types of activities, which cannot be entrusted to
  tags only, e.g. exercise, learning, professional development
  * Automate `billable`, duration unit measurements, and tags within it;
    selecting this on an activity should automatically adjust these attributes
    on a timer
* Security improvements
  * Improve handling of `return_to` functionality
    * Ensure it is a validated route at point of sending
    * Ensure the parameter is read at the `router.ex` level
    * Send the information through to the target in an `on_mount` function
    * Remove the parameter and clean up the URL, redirecting to it, before the
      user can see it, in case they want to bookmark the page
      (https://elixirforum.com/t/how-to-store-return-to-url-when-navigating-from-liveview-to-another-page-liveview-regular/55480/4)
    * Insert it in the render code, as a verified route

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Interface

* [ ] Develop keyboard shortcut functionality for an improved power-user interface
* [ ] Develop command-line interface, providing another input method for power users
* [ ] Develop voice recognition interface, making it possible to use aspects of the application in circumstances where a keyboard doesn't exist (watches), or is impractical (phones), or merely undesirable (tablets)
* [ ] Develop self-contained version of the app—LiveView Native—packaging it as a macOS desktop app, and an iOS iPhone and iPad app, with a potential iWatch app where timers can be quickly started and stopped
